The requirements for the app were that a user must be able to register and login, use CRUD functions of an SQLite database to manipulate data on the app, request or deny permissions, and also recieve notifications for progress updates. This app was designed to track the weight progress of individuals and the user needs were fairly simple in that the user needed to be able to accomplish parts of the requirements like logins and registering but also able to manipulate data in there own database for their specific login.

A login, register, main, and permissions screen were all used to support the user needs. The design was kept simple with two colors and following a consistent theme throughout the app. I think my designs were successful because they were simple and attractive while allowing ease of use by the user.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached coding the app by first creating all of the screens and then coding the activity java files in the order that one would use the app. I started with the login and register activity and then moved to the main and permissions activity. Then I used iterative development and tested as I coded to make sure that parts were remaining functional. These could be applied to the future when I create other applications which consist of more than one activity and screens. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code to make sure that it was functional by running the emulator and testing out each process after I created it and then additionally I tried to break it to see where I needed to add additional error handling. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When I was learning new coding techniques for the app creation itself. I had to get creative with how to use the grid layout since I originally built the project with the legacy list view. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

One area where I feel like where I was very successful was the implemntation of the SQLite Database with the login and registering. I felt like I did this very well and enjoyed the outcome.
